    <h2>The beginnings of Donate Computer</h2>
    <p>
        Donate a computer was not conceived as a philanthropic concept, nor as a humanitarian action, nor as a non-governmental organization that will facilitate aid, within its capabilities, where it is most needed. Donate a Computer started as an individual act of empathy by an IT guy who fixes computers who met a woman with three kids who couldn't follow online classes.<br>
        <br>(Excerpt from an interview with Borche Stamenov): <br><br>The idea as such has always been floating around in my head. Home upbringing has a big part in building my character. Mine were always helpful and never shy to ask for help when they needed it. That is the whole essence of the initiative.Donate Computer I can completely attribute it to my parents. The moment that was decisive for me to start some kind of initiative that would help my fellow citizens happened while I was at work in the company where I have been employed for 21 years. Our customers who purchased new devices kept their old ones. As a new employee, I kept those computers and practiced and studied on them.
        Then a mother came and asked for a used computer for her children. I fixed one, took it away and the idea of Donate Computer was born from the happiness in children's eyes.<br><br>
        Donate a computer is the result of facing the reality that there are families who are not even at the bottom of life's circumstances, and yet children will grow up without proper education just because they do not have an electronic device through which they could follow lessons. And that's only because they can't afford it, and they have nowhere to turn for help, because the institutions they turn to are deaf to their needs.
        Donate a computer started as an action, then an idea came, and then everything happened to end up in an organized movement that today has a legal form.
        <br><br>We are the Benjamin Button of philanthropy...

    <h2>The way of one donation</h2>
    <p>
        The process of getting a computer is quite simple. Anyone who wants to get a computer can do the same through the Donate a Computer page on FB or through the website that the Algorithm high school created for free, where there is information on how to get in touch with us. There is also a form they can fill out that is directly linked to the Donate Computer email address.
        The site itself is designed to automatically answer frequently asked questions.<br><br>
        The conditions are the same for everyone without exception. In order to receive a donation, the person is obliged to submit a certificate of the social status of the family or the individual. Such as, for example, a certificate from the social security for receiving social assistance, a single parent, unemployment, low income, and so on. One device per family is given. In the donation process, there is no possibility to choose whether so
        Exceptions are made when someone mentions to us that they have difficulties with movement or have some condition, so we send those families what they requested if we have it at the moment. The waiting time also depends on what we have available, but it is not longer than 2 weeks. Everyone is notified by a return message on the same day whether the application has been approved or if something else needs to be submitted.
        <br><br>The day before the package is delivered, everyone is contacted to provide information about the cargo delivery (name, surname, exact address and phone number). Normally, in order to successfully complete the story, I ask everyone after receiving the package to let me know how I would remove them from the waiting list.
